Just for assessment.

requirement:
jdk 1.8
mvn 3.8.2 （other version maybe work, the author just use this version and don`t test other version）
docker

1, build
%MVN_HOME%\bin\mvn package -D maven.test.skip=true
when success, there are a jar at %cur_path%\target with name :lrx-exam-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

tip:
  in order to succeed in running all test, you had to change the test input,
  some function, such as user register, can`t register twice using the same input data,
  thus re-run test case will fail.

2, test build
java -jar target/lrx-exam-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
when finished the start, you can access this project via:
http://localhost

tip:
this project used derby as persist storage, thus, running it will automatically generate a new package: lrx_test
thus there are two issues:
1, removing lrx_test will remove data.
2, make sure that creating a director was allowed (especially under *ninx environment).

3, build docker
docker build  -t test:lrx_test .
docker run -p 80:80 test:lrx_test

then ,you can access via: http://localhost/
